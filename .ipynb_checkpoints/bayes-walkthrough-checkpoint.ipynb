    "- Bayesian statistics is a branch of statistics that allows us to directly estimate some parameter of interest with a distribution.\n",
    "    - In this case, we'll say our parameter of interest is the percentage of votes the Democratic candidate earns:\n",
    "    $$p_D$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Rather than saying \"the Democrat will win 53% of the vote ($p_D = 0.53$),\" we can estimate the percentage of votes the Democrat will get with a distribution. This is beneficial because we can directly account for uncertainty in our forecasts. (i.e. The Democrat is likely to win 53%, but it's reasonable that they win between 48% and 58% of the vote.)\n",
    "- Bayesian inference is also beneficial because we can combine our data (likelihood) with our prior beliefs about the parameter of interest."
